## Overview
An analysis is requested of the August 2019 published ridership data for New York City's Citi Bike program to evalualate the feasibility of a similar program in Des Moines, IA.  Data was assesed basis age, gender, customer type, trip duration and start/stop points in the area.  Tableau Public was used to generate compelling visual illustrations of the data.  These illustrations were then compiled into a Tableau Story book for presentation.

## Summary
New York City's program makes a strong case for the viability of expansion or similar programs in other cities with a robust base of subscribership and high utilization rates in the assessed month.  Ridership is condensed with start and end locations well distributed ensuring that there are generally bikes available where needed.
