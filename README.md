## Overview
An analysis is requested of the August 2019 published ridership data for New York City's Citi Bike program to evalualate the feasibility of a similar program in Des Moines, IA.  Data was assesed basis age, gender, customer type, trip duration and start/stop points in the area.  Tableau Public was used to generate compelling visual illustrations of the data.  These illustrations were then compiled into a Tableau Story book for presentation.

## Results
New York City's program makes a strong case for the viability of expansion or similar programs in other cities with a robust base of subscribership and high utilization rates in the assessed month.  Ridership is condensed with start and end locations well distributed ensuring that there are generally bikes available where needed.

### Peak Hours and Repair Needs
Highest usage of the Citi Bikes occurs between 3pm and 7pm with a distinct lull coming between 1am and 4am.  With very high utilization of many of the bikes, this lull would be an ideal time to perform routine maintenance and repairs.

### Customer Type and Gender Stats
New York City's program benefits from a high rate of subscribed riders.  These riders consistently take the most trips throughout the week and make up the bulk of ridership.

Male riders are the most consistent users of the Citi Bike program and male subscribers are the most prolific users.  Additionally the heavy usage up through 8am and after 4pm during the week indicate that the program is being used as a commute option.

By and large rides last under 20 minutes, and male riders are taking over 60% of these trips.

## Summary
New York City's model for the bike sharing program makes a good case for replication or expansion.
